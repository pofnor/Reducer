Benefits of useReducer:

1-Predictable State Changes:
useReducer is useful for managing complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

2-Centralized Logic:
The logic for state transitions is centralized in the reducer function, making it easier to manage and understand, especially as your application grows.

3-Separation of Concerns:
Reducer logic is separated from component logic, promoting a cleaner and more modular code structure.

4-DevTools Integration:
useReducer plays well with browser dev tools, providing a better debugging experience.

Consider using useReducer when your state logic becomes more complex, and you need a structured approach to handle it. For simpler cases, useState might be more concise and easier to understand.
